# Editor

Quaver comes with a fully featured editor that contains many different tools to help create your dream map.

* [Getting Started](/docs/Editor/Getting_started)
* [Editor Functions](/docs/Editor/Editor_functions)
* [Plugins](/docs/Editor/plugins)

## I made a map in another game and I want to upload it to Quaver's website!

* Make sure the map is converted to Quaver. If your map is linked via "detect other games", then you will have to **right click -> export** and then re-import it from a .qp file. It should be given the "unsubmitted" status.
* Make sure "creator" matches with your Quaver username. This can be modified through **Edit -> Edit Metadata** button.
* Now you can upload your set as usual **(File -> Upload)**.
